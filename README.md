change-wallpaper
================

Edit the directory variable 'dir' to point to the directory containing jpg wallpaper files. This script finds all jpg files in that directory and randomly picks one.

This is set to update the desktop background using gsetting (with Cinnamon in this case). Feel free to update to your flavor of choice.
